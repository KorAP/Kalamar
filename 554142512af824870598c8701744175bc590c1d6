In addition I fear that I wouldn\u0027t even notice if there was a change. Let\u0027s follow our IoD approach and empty it completely. I think this really makes sense.\n(The only one thing that also made some sense in the content area was news, preceded and ordered by a date, so that you can quickly scan if it is worth another look.)\n\nWhat do you think?",

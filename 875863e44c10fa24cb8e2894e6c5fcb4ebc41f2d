      "message": "Good finding! The space is more important for the annotation helper itself than for the mouseover. And the mouseover somehow doesn\u0027t expect a trailing space for key:value annotations. I guess it\u0027s better to rewrite the mouseover to check both for fields with and without trailing spaces.\n\nThe annotations should be lowercase, otherwise the foundry helper looks good to me!",

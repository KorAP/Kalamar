I\u0027d only ad a) prefer \"Architecture \u0026 Development\" to have the buzzword in it.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if I quite understand all questions. As a general remark: We can add an intro the QL page later (https://github.com/KorAP/Kalamar/issues/140 ). Concerning Architecture \u0026 Development: I think it\u0027s not so important here, any more. Maybe we can reduce the sub-menu entries here later.",

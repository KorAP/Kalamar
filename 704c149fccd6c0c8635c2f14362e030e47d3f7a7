      "message": "I guess the best way to proceed is to remove the scroll-part from this change. If you have problems to remove the fragment from the perl code, I can help, of course. But I guess, the real solution is to change the position of the top, by having `name` attributes instead of `id`s, so the notion of \"top\" can be different based on the time of layout.",

When the behaviour to not use page-top is preferred, the simplest solution is probably to remove the fragment advice from KalamarPages.pm. If the page-top is not the correct element (both for embedded and iframed documentations), it should be reassigned.\nChanging this here seems to me unnecessary and also hard to maintain (because everything in init.js is currently untested and therefore likely to break, while there are lots of tests for page-top in the test suite.",

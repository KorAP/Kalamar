      "message": "The goal is to upgrade Jasmine and allow for a headless test run in the terminal (as part of the CI run in the future). Some of the tests fail for newer versions of Jasmine, so I need to adapt them. Jasmine works fine with ES6 - so we may keep it instead of Vite, but it\u0027s rather complicated to get it to work with AMD/requireJS. It works now okay-ish, but I need to go through all specs iteratively.",

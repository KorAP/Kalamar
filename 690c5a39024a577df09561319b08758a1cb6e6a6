Thank you very much for your work!\n\nThere are some general issues, as the test suite currently fails, the documentation has no navigation and some media queries don\u0027t work properly, but overall that looks pretty good! I like the top bar. However, I don\u0027t think it can completely replace the left navigation bar (for settings and documentation).",
